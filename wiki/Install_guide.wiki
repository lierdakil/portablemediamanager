#summary A short guide on installing

= Gentoo =

There is a gentoo ebuild available. You can get it on [http://code.google.com/p/portablemediamanager/downloads/list Downloads] page.

If you want some help on creating and maintaining local portage overlay, I suggest you to consult Gentoo Wiki: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Overlays#Creating_a_local_overlay

= Other systems =

There are no prebuilt packages (yet). So you will most likely need to checkout desired version from svn and build it from source.

Currently, only one version is available -- development, or trunk.

== Checkout ==

To checkout sources from repository, you will need subversion client (usually called subversion or svn-cilent in your distribution repository). After installing it, choose a directory to store sources in (for example, /home/user/src) and execute 
{{{
cd /home/user/src
svn checkout "http://portablemediamanager.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/" portablemediamanager
}}}

then cd to Portabe Media Manager source directory
{{{
cd portablemediamanager
}}}

and run qmake, make and sudo make install
{{{
qmake portablemediamanager.pro
make
sudo make install
}}}

this will install binaries to /usr/bin, application icon to /usr/share/pixmaps and desktop file to /usr/share/applications. Now you should have Portable media Manager launch icon under Audio/Video category in your desktop environment's launch menu.

To uninstall, simply execute
{{{
make uninstall
}}}
in Portabe Media Manager source directory.
